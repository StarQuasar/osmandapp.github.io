<p>2020 is the Covid-19 pandemic year and it is a very difficult year for the travel industry. But all this year we worked for our users and make super applications for you. Year to year we see the growth of active users, this year is no exception.</p>
<p>In June 2020 our company <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/10-years">celebrated 10 years old</a>. We made Mega Sale and send more than 150 T-shirts for our users.</p>

	<h4>Android</h4>

<p>OsmAnd Android got 4 major releases this year: <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-6-released">3.6</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-7-released">3.7</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-8-released">3.8</a> and <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-9-released">3.9</a> (we released 3.9 but while Goole rejected it) with more than <a href="https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/milestones?state=closed">300 public features and issues closed on Github</a>. Among all these features we’ve selected 4 major features which were in the Resolutions list for 2020.</p>

	<li><b>Export/import all settings and data</b><br>

<div class="blogimageblock">

<img src="/images/blog/3.9/2.jpg" alt="(Image not available offline)"/>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

<p>In all four releases, we have improved the settings for navigation profiles, which can already be called device profiles. Now you can customize and manage not only the appearance and profile settings, but also customize the application menu completely for yourself. Also, now you can do a full export / import of all settings and data for the application profile.</p>




	<li><b>"Plan a route" tool</b><br> 

<p>We renamed the "Measure distance" tool to <a href="https://osmand.net/features/plan-route">"Plan a route"</a>. We have completely reworked the old instrument so that the user is comfortable creating his own track or working with the old one. Now planning and creating a route for your trip is even easier and more functional.</p>

</div>

<p>By developing <a href="https://osmand.net/features/plan-route">"Plan a route"</a> we have improved the performance and settings of the GPX-tracks. Now you can change the appearance of your GPX-tracks, call up the menu by clicking on a GPX-track on the map, analyze a GPX-track. Added the ability to calculate the route for the selected GPX-track.
It's even easier to enable GPX-track navigation.</p>

	<h4>iOS</h4>

<p>We’ve managed to release <b>7 new versions</b> of OsmAnd for iOS this year (<a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-2-5-released">2.5</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-2-7-released">2.7</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-2-8-released">2.8</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-2-9-released">2.9</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-3-0-released">3.0</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-3-10-released">3.10</a>, <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-ios-3-11-released">3.11</a>)! All this was possible due to the commitment and hard work of our iOS team to catch up with Android. We hope 2020 to be a year in which almost all features present in OsmAnd will be equal for both Android and iOS version. Here the list of main features released this year for the iPhones and iPads.</p>

	<li><b>OsmAnd Live</b><br> 

<p><a href="https://osmand.net/features/subscription">OsmAnd Live</a> is a subscription that provides you numerous benefits, including unlimited map downloads, access to all paid features and hourly map updates.</p>

<p>OSM Editing allows you to make contributions to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, a global community aimed at creating a comprehensive map of the world and providing up-to-date open-source data to every user.</p>

<h3>New Year Resolutions 2020</h3>

<p>We are going to start next year with an extended team of 7 software engineers. We grew 20% compared to the previous year and it is good news. We can probably do 10% more in 2020 :-)</p>

<p>Our list is growing every year and, as of today, we have around 1500 requests waiting to be fixed or implemented. That’s why, it is important for us to set up some public goals and try to follow them to a certain extent.</p>

<h4>GENERAL</h4>

<ul class="textlist">
	<li><b>New slopes / hillshade maps</b><br> In 2019 we’ve released updated contour lines worldwide and started working on new raster hillshade and slope maps. We want to provide more detailed raster maps and also add a new type of maps to better visualize slopes.</li><br>

	<li><b>Profiles on Android + iOS</b><br> This is considered to be the most important feature of 2020. The implementation has already started in 2019 and now Android users can create / import and export custom profiles with user-defined settings. We’re going to continue profile’s customization, so every profile could look and feel as a separate geo-specialized application. We also want to make it easy to share  the profiles with others.</li><br>

</ul>

<h4>Android</h4>

<ul class="textlist">
	<li><b>OpenGL-rendering + 2.5D</b><br> This is a long running feature for several years and we have a prototype build, we’ve already added some features to our roadmap to be implemented. Though we are not planning to make it mainstream unless it will be very successful. You can always check out the version we have at <a href="https://download.osmand.net/latest-night-build/OsmAnd-qt-arm-nightly.apk">our build server</a>.</li><br>

	<li><b>Travel + Wikivoyage improvements</b><br> This year we didn’t manage to implement many features related to Wikivoyage, though it is always in our focus. We plan to make a second version inspired by our new plugin architecture.</li><br>

	<li><b>Local GPX-access</b><br> Every year we develop many tiny and useful features related to GPX and this year was not an exception. We’ve closed more than 50 GPX-related issues. In 2020 we plan to add new features, that will change the way of ineraction with the GPX tracks on the map, browsing and searching among large list of GPX files and add new ways of visualizing GPX-activities.</li><br>
</ul>

<h4>iOS</h4>

<ul class="textlist">
	<li><b>Public Transport</b><br> This feature was completed for Android in 2019 and we plan to migrate all the implemented solutions to the iOS version in 2020. So OSM-ers with iPhones will get a new motivation to map public transport in OSM (<a href="https://osmand.net/blog/guideline-pt">check out our guideline</a>).</li><br>

	<li><b>Measure Distance</b><br> We’ve got a lot of requests for <a href="https://osmand.net/features/measure-distance">this tool</a> and for sure it is number 1 priority to get it for iOS in 2020.</li><br>

	<li><b>GPX</b><br> While the Android version has more advanced GPX-related features, the iOS version still lacks some base route graphs and stats. Of course it is very important for us not to miss those next year.</li><br>
</ul>


<p><b>Sure, hundreds of small features didn’t get to this list though they’re going to be implemented in 2020.</b></p>

<b><p>Happy 2020 and let’s welcome 2020 OsmAnd!!!</b></p>
